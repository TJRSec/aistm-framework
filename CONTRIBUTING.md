# Contributing to AISTM

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AISTM (AI Security Testing Model) project.

This model is intended to be a practical, community-driven methodology for assessing AI-enabled applications. Contributions that improve clarity, coverage, examples, and mappings to other frameworks are especially welcome.

## Contribution Ideas

Not sure where to start? Here are areas where contributions would be valuable:

- **Test cases** — Additional example assessments for different AI architectures (RAG, agentic, multi-modal)
- **OWASP mappings** — Explicit mappings of OWASP AI Testing Guide techniques to Layer 2
- **Translations** — Localized versions of the methodology
- **Tool integrations** — Guidance on using AISTM with existing security tools
- **Templates** — Assessment report templates, checklists, or scoring rubrics
